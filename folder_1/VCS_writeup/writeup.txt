A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps developers track and manage changes to code over time. Git is the most popular and widely used distributed VCS today. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.

With Git, every change made to the codebase is recorded in a repository. Developers can create branches to experiment or add new features independently, then merge them back into the main code when ready. This ensures code stability, encourages collaboration, and allows easy rollback to previous versions in case of errors.
